One day, a young shoemaker went down into the cellars – he was lucky and he met the golden duck, who promised him riches. However, she said there was only one condition: she gave him a bag full of golden coins but he had to spend them all within one day and not share his riches with anyone. He bought himself fine clothes, dined in the most expensive Warsaw restaurant and went to see a play at the National Theatre. It was almost the end of the day as the boy broke the condition: he gave a last coin to a poor soldier. In a blink of an eye, he lost everything he had purchased with the gold coins. And that’s when he understood that money does not make one happy: true happiness comes from work and good health. Thereafter, he lived the good life of a master cobbler and nobody ever heard about the golden duck again.\n\n",

Instead of it people suggested to ask tailor to kill the beast and spare his life if he succeeded. The city council agreed. Tailor prepared for the fight by buying a large mirror and sneaking into the basement around dusk, when the basilisk was still sleeping.

The Polish resistance was forced to begin their uprising much sooner than planned and without help from the Allied forces due to mounting tensions with the Nazis. The Polish Underground Scouting, known during wartime as the Gray Ranks, played an integral role in the resistance, mostly by carrying messages for the troops, but sometimes they also obtained German helmets and guns to fight on the front lines. By the end of the 63-day battle, Polish resistance had managed to kill 8,000 Nazi soldiers and wound around the same number. But when the Nazis destroyed the city the resistance deaths had climbed to 16,000 people, and the civilian including the Jews, reached as high as 200,000. Hitler and Himmler went on to destroy almost 90% of the buildings in the area. \n\nDesign for the Little Insurrectionist was created in 1946, just two years after the massacre, but the statue wasn’t built until 1983.
